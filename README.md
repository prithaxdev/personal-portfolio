# Personal Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio website built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vite. It showcases my projects, skills, and experiences in a modern, responsive design.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs
- Vite: A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects

## Features

- Responsive design that looks great on desktop and mobile

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js (version 14 or later) and pnpm installed on your machine.

If you don't have pnpm installed, you can install it by running:

## Customization
